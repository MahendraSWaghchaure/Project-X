ðŸ“š Second: Pages to create (by role)
âœ… Public Pages (pages/public/)
Home.jsx

About.jsx

Contact.jsx

TermsAndConditions.jsx (optional)

FAQ.jsx (optional)

âœ… Authentication Pages (pages/auth/)
Login.jsx

Register.jsx (optional - mostly for drivers if needed)

ForgotPassword.jsx (optional)

âœ… Parent Pages (pages/parents/)
ParentDashboard.jsx

TrackBus.jsx (live location map)

StudentAttendance.jsx

Notifications.jsx (bus delays, arrival notifications)

âœ… Admin Pages (pages/schoolAdmin/)
AdminDashboard.jsx

BusManagement.jsx (CRUD buses: Add, Edit, Delete)

DriverManagement.jsx (CRUD drivers)

StudentManagement.jsx (CRUD students)

RouteManagement.jsx (Create/Edit routes for buses)

âœ… Driver Pages (pages/driver/)
DriverDashboard.jsx

AssignedRoute.jsx (show today's assigned route)

Attendance.jsx (mark students as boarded/dropped)

âœ… Student Pages (pages/students/)
StudentDashboard.jsx

BusTracking.jsx (view their bus location in real-time)

ðŸš€ Bonus Suggestion (for Enterprise Level)
âœ… Real-time Location - (WebSocket or Firebase Live Update)
âœ… Push Notifications - (when bus arriving in 5 mins)
âœ… Role Based Access - (admin/parent/driver can't access others' pages)
âœ… Map Integration - (Google Maps, Leaflet.js)
